Archive a completed initiative by compiling the current architectural state into `opensprint/architecture.md`.

**Input**: Specify the initiative name after `/opsp:archive` (e.g., `/opsp:archive migrate-to-serverless`). If omitted, list active initiatives.

---

## Steps

### 1. Verify Initiative Completion

Read `opensprint/initiatives/<name>.md` and check:
- Are all milestones marked as done?
- If not, warn the operator and ask for confirmation to proceed

### 2. Compile architecture.md

Read all source materials:
- `opensprint/driver-specs/*.md` — all active driver specs
- `opensprint/ADRs/*.md` — all active/accepted ADRs
- `opensprint/DECISION-MAP.md` — the decision tree

Then **rewrite** `opensprint/architecture.md` with these sections:

#### System Overview
Synthesize from driver-specs: what is this system, what does it do, why does it exist?
Write as a narrative, not a list of specs.

#### Driver Specs
Compile a narrative of active driver specs, grouped by type (product, legal, compliance, etc.).
Link to each spec by ID for traceability.

#### Architectural Decisions
Walk the decision tree in narrative form. For each significant decision:
- State the decision and its rationale
- Reference the ADR by ID (e.g., "We chose serverless architecture (DEC-001) because...")
- Show how decisions chain together

#### System Structure
Describe the current system architecture — services, components, data stores, interfaces.
This should be derivable from the decisions but stated concretely:
"The system consists of: Auth Service (Lambda), Payment API (Lambda), ..."

Use ASCII diagrams where they help:
```
┌──────────┐     ┌──────────┐     ┌──────────┐
│   Auth   │────▶│   API    │────▶│   Jobs   │
│ Service  │     │ Gateway  │     │ Service  │
└──────────┘     └──────────┘     └──────────┘
                       │
                       ▼
                 ┌──────────┐
                 │ DynamoDB │
                 └──────────┘
```

#### Constraints & Non-Negotiables
Extract from driver-specs the hard constraints that bound all implementation:
- Compliance requirements (SOC2, GDPR, etc.)
- Performance requirements (latency, throughput)
- Legal requirements (data residency, retention)
- Business constraints (pricing model, SLA)

### 3. Mark Initiative Completed

Update the initiative descriptor:
- Set `status: completed`
- Add `completed: <YYYY-MM-DD>` to frontmatter
- Ensure all opsx change references are listed

### 4. Display Summary

```
## Archive Complete

**Initiative:** migrate-to-serverless
**Status:** Completed
**Driver Specs:** 3 active
**ADRs:** 5 active
**OPSX Changes:** 3 completed
**architecture.md:** Updated ✓

The architectural state of the solution has been compiled.
Review opensprint/architecture.md for the complete picture.
```

## Key Principles

- **Synthesize, don't copy-paste** — architecture.md should read as a coherent document, not a concatenation of specs
- **Rewrite completely** — Don't append to existing architecture.md. Rewrite it with current state. ADRs are the version history.
- **Link to sources** — Reference driver-spec and ADR IDs so readers can drill into details
- **Readable by humans** — This is the document you'd hand to a new team member to understand the system
- **Readable by agents** — This is also what the surrogate reads to answer future questions

---

## Guardrails

- **Verify milestones** — Warn if initiative has incomplete milestones
- **Rewrite, don't append** — architecture.md captures current state only
- **Use path.join()** — Construct all file paths cross-platform
- **Preserve ADRs** — Never modify or delete ADRs during archive. They are the permanent trail.
